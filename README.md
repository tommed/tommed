<h2 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an an Enterprise-scalable automated governance system at [Vigilant](https://github.com/VigilantApps) which ensures employees are using their work privileges ethically. It's been 10yrs in the making! I mainly work in [Go](https://go.dev), [dotNET](https://dot.net), [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).

I also invented the _only_ known ethical method of recording end-2-end encrypted instant messenger conversations (e.g. WhatsApp, WeChat, BBME, Telegram, Signal), which has been used throughout the banking industry (particularly trading banks), for employee governance and compliance reasons via our specialised resellers and partners.

As you can probably tell, ethical behaviour of employees who have _'special access'_ to digital assets/systems is something of particular personal interest to me. I believe companies are responsible for ensuring their staff do not misuse company systems for their own personal or financial gain. We owe a duty of care (and respect) to the people whose details are held within our data systems!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also really interested in nutrition and general health. Did you know for example that [daily use of mouthwash can reduce your gym gains by up to 60%](https://is.gd/AYIwxr)?!! ðŸ˜µ
