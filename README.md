### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an an Enterprise-scalable automated governance system at [Vigilant](https://github.com/VigilantApps) which ensures employees are using their work privileges ethically. I mainly work in [Go](https://go.dev), [dotNET](https://dot.net), [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).

I also invented the _only_ known ethic method of recording end-2-end encrypted instant messenger conversations, which has been used throughout the banking industry (particularly trading banks), for employee governance and compliance reasons.

As you can probably tell, ethical behaviour of employees who have _special access_ to data and assets is something of particular interest to me personally. I believe companies are responsible for ensuring their staff do not misuse company systems for their own personal or financial gain. We owe a duty of care (and respect) to the people whose details are held within our data systems!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also really interested in nutrition and general health. Did you know for example that [daily use of mouthwash can reduce your gym gains by up to 60%](https://is.gd/AYIwxr)?!! ðŸ˜µ
